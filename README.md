#PÃ¢ques en folie

Video game for Easter


# Ideas

- You are the Easter Bunny. Kids chase you. You drop eggs to distract them and make them go away. But they can come in from any direction so constantly be on the lookout.

#The game engine

- uses ImpactJS game engine (you must provide the engine which requires a license) but all other source code is here



#Setup
- requires the ImpactJS game engine impactjs.com
- Install the impact-node server by typing ```npm install -g impact-node``` and then type ```impact-node serve``` and go to http://localhost:3000
- Does not require ```impact-node``` but is set up for it and is missing some of Impact's tools for building using bake script.
- Dev code changes are seen in localhost:3000. To build, type ```impact-node build```</li>

### Common mistake with impact-node

To create a new project, the command `create:project` is not the name of your project, it is the command:

**ERROR `create:mygame`**

**CORRECT `create:project`**

</ul>
